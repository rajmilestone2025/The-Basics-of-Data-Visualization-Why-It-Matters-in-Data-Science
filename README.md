Discover the importance of data visualization in data science. Learn how to uncover insights, improve decision-making, and communicate data effectively.
Data visualization is the art of representing data in a visual format, using graphs and charts. It eases the interpretation of complex datasets, enabling the viewer to recognize patterns, trends, and insights more quickly. In data science, data visualization enables a better communication of findings to allow for better decision-making. This form of communication comes into play by presenting information so that there is minimal space between raw data and useful insights. Data visualization tools also enable data scientists to easily identify outliers, relationships, and key metrics so that the overall analysis process is sped up while increasing audience engagement.
